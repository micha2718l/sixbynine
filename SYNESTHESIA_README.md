# ⚡ Synesthesia Engine - Reality Painter

## The Ultimate Multi-Sensory Experience

**Synesthesia Engine** is the most intense interactive art experience ever created - a consciousness-bending fusion where you paint reality itself across 5 dimensions, with cross-sensory feedback where colors make sounds, sounds create shapes, and particles develop consciousness.

---

## 🌌 Core Concept

Paint across parallel dimensions. Create gravity wells that warp space. Distort time itself. Generate infinite fractal patterns. Give particles consciousness. Watch your past actions echo through time.

**This is not just art. This is reality manipulation.**

## 🔬 Technical Deep Dive

### Physics Simulation
```javascript
// Gravity force calculation
force = (well.strength / distance) * gravityMultiplier
particle.velocity += (direction / distance) * force

// Time dilation
particle.position += particle.velocity * timeDilation
particle.decay *= timeDilation
```

### Fractal Recursion
```javascript
// Recursive branching
function createBranch(x, y, depth, maxDepth, length, angle) {
  if (depth >= maxDepth) return;
  
  // Create particles along branch
  // Spawn 2-4 child branches
  // Recursively call with reduced length
}
```

### Consciousness Logic
```javascript
// Decision-making
if (particle.conscious && random() < 0.01) {
  particle.target = randomOtherParticle();
}

if (particle.target) {
  attraction = particle.decision > 0.5 ? 0.1 : -0.1;
  particle.velocity += direction * attraction;
}
```
