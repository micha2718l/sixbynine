# 🌌 Quantum Poetry Visualizer

## An Interactive Generative Art Experience

**Quantum Poetry Visualizer** is a one-of-a-kind web application that combines:
- 🎨 Real-time particle physics simulation
- 📜 Quantum-inspired poetry generation
- 🎵 Adaptive ambient soundscapes
- ✨ Interactive chaos theory visualizations

Every moment is unique - poems emerge from mathematical chaos, influenced by your movements and interactions.

## ✨ Features

### Visual Magic
- **300+ particles** forming a quantum field with emergent behavior
- **Lorenz attractor dynamics** creating mesmerizing fluid motion
- **Real-time mouse influence** - your cursor shapes the quantum state
- **Particle connections** that form and dissolve organically
- **Multi-layered glow effects** with dynamic color shifting

### Poetry Generation
- **Seeded randomness** using quantum state parameters
- **3 thematic universes**: Cosmic, Natural, and Existential
- **Dynamic structure** - poems vary from 4-6 lines
- **Fade-in animation** synchronized with soundscape
- **Truly unique** - every generation is different

### Audio Landscape
- **Ambient tones** harmonized to quantum state
- **Interactive sound effects** responding to your actions
- **Frequency modulation** based on entropy and coherence
- **Gentle harmonics** that don't overpower the experience

### Quantum State System
- **Entropy** - controlled by vertical mouse position
- **Coherence** - controlled by horizontal mouse position  
- **Resonance** - evolves naturally over time
- **Real-time display** showing all quantum parameters

## 🎮 Controls

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Move Mouse** | Influence the quantum field and particle behavior |
| **Single Click** | Create an energy burst with 20 particles |
| **Double Click** | Generate a spiral vortex with 60 particles |
| **Space** | Regenerate poem with new quantum state |
| **C Key** | Cosmic explosion! 500 particles + new poem |

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```
4. Open your browser to: `http://localhost:8080`
5. **Enable audio** - some browsers require user interaction first

## 🧪 The Science Behind It

### Lorenz Attractor
The particle motion is influenced by the famous Lorenz attractor equations:
- `dx = 10 * (entropy - x)`
- `dy = x * (28 - y) - y`
- `dz = x * y - 2.667 * coherence`

This creates the characteristic "butterfly effect" and chaotic but beautiful patterns.

### Quantum-Inspired Poetry
Poems are generated using:
1. **Deterministic seeding** from quantum state + timestamp
2. **Pseudo-random generator** for reproducible randomness
3. **Word banks** organized by theme and emotion
4. **Grammar templates** for natural language structure
5. **Thematic coherence** within each poem

### Audio Synthesis
- **Web Audio API** for real-time synthesis
- **Multiple oscillators** creating layered harmonics
- **Frequency mapping** from quantum parameters
- **Exponential decay** for smooth fade-outs

## 🎨 Technical Details
