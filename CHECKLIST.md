git status
```

You should see:
- 13 files ready to commit
- ~79.5 KB of code
- No ignored files

### Step 4: Create Initial Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: SIXBYNINE Interactive Art Gallery

```

### Step 5: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `sixbynine` (or your choice)
3. Description: "Three extraordinary interactive art experiences"
4. Make it **Public** (required for GitHub Pages)
5. Do NOT initialize with README (you have one)
6. Do NOT add .gitignore (none needed)
7. Do NOT add license yet (optional, can add later)
8. Click **Create repository**

### Step 6: Connect to GitHub
```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sixbynine.git
```

### Step 7: Verify Remote
```bash
git remote -v
```

Should show:
```
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sixbynine.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sixbynine.git (push)
```

### Step 8: Push to GitHub
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 9: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** (top right)
3. Scroll down left sidebar to **Pages**
4. Under "Source":
   - Select branch: **main**
   - Select folder: **/ (root)**
5. Click **Save**
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

### Step 10: Get Your URL
Your site will be live at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/sixbynine/gallery.html
```

Individual experiences:
- Quantum Poetry: `.../index.html`
- Dreamscape: `.../dreamscape.html`
- Synesthesia: `.../synesthesia.html`

## 🧪 POST-DEPLOYMENT TESTING

### Test Checklist (After Going Live)

- [ ] Gallery loads at `.../gallery.html`
- [ ] All three cards visible and styled
- [ ] Click "Quantum Poetry" → Loads index.html
- [ ] Click "Neural Dreamscape" → Loads dreamscape.html
- [ ] Click "Synesthesia Engine" → Loads synesthesia.html
- [ ] Audio works in each experience
- [ ] Canvas rendering works
- [ ] Mouse controls work
- [ ] Keyboard controls work
- [ ] README.md displays on main repo page
- [ ] No 404 errors in browser console

### If Something Doesn't Work

**Problem**: Gallery doesn't load
**Solution**: Make sure you're accessing `.../gallery.html` not just `.../`

**Problem**: Experience loads but no audio
**Solution**: Click anywhere to trigger audio context (browser security)

**Problem**: Styles broken
**Solution**: Check file paths are relative (they should be)

**Problem**: 404 errors
**Solution**: Verify all files pushed with `git ls-files`
